- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ananotherone
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning how to code by learning some different programming languages. The languages that I am most interested in learning at the moment are: HTML/CSS/javaScript and PYthon. I am just starting at the beginning of my journey and so this may change along the way.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning by utilizing resources that I have found on freeCodeCamp.org, W3Schools, reading different guides or forums (Flavio, Mozilla, CodeAcademy just to name a few).
